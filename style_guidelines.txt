Overall Look and Feel of BookPortal
-----------------------------------
The look and feel of BookPortal should be modern and welcoming, with a clean, user-friendly design. We aim to create a professional yet approachable website that reflects the values of learning, accessibility, and innovation.


Colours
--------
BookPortal's colors convey trust, creativity, and a focus on knowledge. The colors should be soothing and professional to create a pleasant experience. Here are our primary color choices:

#f4a42c (primary accent)
#ab7209 (heading color)
#ffa500 (hover and link accent)
#f0f0f0 (background elements)
#333333 (text color)


Iconography
-----------
Icons should have a minimalistic, flat design to align with the overall aesthetic. Icons will be used sparingly and only where necessary to enhance user understanding and engagement.


Typography
----------
We will be using Lato from Google Fonts. This font will help create a modern, professional look. Font sizes should be used consistently across headings, body text, and smaller elements to maintain readability and structure.


Links
-----
Links will not be underlined by default. They will change to the hover accent color (#ffa500) when hovered over to give feedback to the user. Link styles should be consistent across the website.


Buttons
-------
Buttons will be designed with a flat style to maintain a modern appearance. The primary button color will be #f4a42c, with a hover effect that subtly changes the shade. Buttons should be rounded and have clear labels for their function.
